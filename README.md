# Project Title

## Introduction

In the industry, you will work on an existing codebase 90% of the time. Your first thoughts upon looking at it might include:

- “Who did this code?”
- “How does it work?”
- “Where are unittests?”
- “Where is this?”
- “Why did they do that like this?”
- “I don’t understand anything.”
- “… I will refactor everything…”

But the worst thing you could possibly do is to redo everything. Please don’t do that! Note: the existing codebase might be perfect, or it might have errors. Don’t always trust the existing codebase!

## Project Setup

You will fork this codebase:

- Update the repository name to `AirBnB_clone_v2`
- Update the `README.md` with your information but don’t delete the initial authors

If you are the owner of this repository, please create a new repository named `AirBnB_clone_v2` with the same content as `AirBnB_clone`.

### Repository:

- **GitHub repository:** AirBnB_clone_v2

All your unittests must pass without any errors at any time in this project, with each storage engine! Same for PEP8!

To test with MySQL:

1. Create a specific database.
2. Validate actions by comparing states before and after.

Example:

```python
import MySQLdb

# Your code to interact with MySQL
